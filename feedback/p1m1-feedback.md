# Project 1, Milestone 1 Feedback

This milestone is graded for a **completion grade _by task**. This is a feedback milestone. If you tried to complete the task, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that task**. If a task is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. **There is no partial credit within a specific task.**

We provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. Our feedback is designed to help you learn more; our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). **Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you receive, you are responsible for meeting all of the project's requirements for the final submission.**

_For milestone 1, you refined your existing static site's design using a persona._


## Grader Instructions

- **Specify the reason for any points deducted!**
- A student must demonstrate a **good-faith effort to receive full credit** for a specific section.

    Mistakes are okay. **This is about feedback.**

    It's possible to not check any boxes in a section and still issue full credit for that section (again, good-faith effort, even if incorrect).

    **0 is for incomplete work**; 0 is not for incorrect work.

Grader, enter the student-that-you-are-grading's NetID below. Now check that _this_ file has that same NetID in the filename. Now check that you have checked out this same student's work from GitHub.

**Student's NetID:** is389
