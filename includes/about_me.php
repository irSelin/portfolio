  Hi, I'm Isabel Selin, a computer science undergraduate student at Cornell University (class of 2022). I'm currently minoring in both game design and fine art, hoping to combine my creative interests with my technical skills.

  In addition to programming, I enjoy character design and animation in my spare time.
